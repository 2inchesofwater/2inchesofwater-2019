Description: 

Musta was proposed as a mobile app fitness trainer payment and organisation system, a potential lead generator, and business companion for fitness training professionals.

The app's UX design hypothesised that a key pain point for freelance fitness trainers was negotiating their available times with individual (prospective) clients. We focused on streamlining flows for a trainer to manage their calendar, and a prospective client to pair with a suitable trainer.

UX/UI design by Dan Gilmore for iFactory.
