Description: 

Noosa Radiology is the largest radiology clinic on the Sunshine Coast, Gympie and Fraser Coast regions.

Noosa Radiology, situated in the Noosaville Medical & Professional Centre, is the largest radiology clinic on the Sunshine Coast, Gympie and Fraser Coast regions. Established by Dr Drew McMenamin in 2009. The clinic has introduced the latest in radiological equipment, techniques and dose reduction technology to the region. The business recently expanded to a second site at Gympie, and so a sister site was factored into the design process.
