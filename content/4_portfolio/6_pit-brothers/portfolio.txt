Description: 

Startup barbecuing equipment business Pit Brothers plans to carve a sizeable portion of the boutique slow-cooked meats market with a range of ingredients and specialised cooking gear.

The brief emphasised a masculine energy wrapped around a craftsman mindset. We proposed features to support customers sharing their personal takes on the site's recipes.
