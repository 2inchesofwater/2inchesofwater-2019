Description: 

Performax is all about bringing colossal American pick-up trucks to Australia. They convert the imported trucks and high performance sports cars to Australian standards - most notably swapping the steering column to the right-hand side. 

In the RHD conversion business since 1989, Performax International is the largest independent importer, converter and retailer of American vehicles in Australia. It has unrivalled experience, technical expertise and resources to get you behind the wheel of the American pick-up or sports car of your dreams. 

They wanted their new site to be bold, confident, and highly visual. Their target market is primarily wealthy farmers who demand the best, most powerful farm vehicles available. Importing and converting a pickup from the USA is a small price to pay for a machine that will keep up with their workload.
