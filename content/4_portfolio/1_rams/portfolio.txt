Description: 

RAMS is a subsidiary of the Westpac Group, offering a range of flexible and affordable home loans since 1995. 

Our team introduced a key innovation for this client. We added responsive design to a customers' list of transactions.

We designed a standards-compliant HTML table which can hinge between a traditional rows-based layout on large screens, but collapse to a stacked layout on handheld devices. 

We believe this capability is unique within the Australian online banking industry. It demonstrates our commitment to supporting all customers regardless of how they interact with our product.
