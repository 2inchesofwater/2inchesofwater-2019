Description: 

Delphi Bank is a specialised brand under Australia's Bendigo Bank. Its history is entwined with European communities and business owners. 

Data research revealed several extraordinary banking patterns among its customers, notably very high numbers of accounts per person. Armed with this insight, our team designed UI features to support quickly navigating long lists of accounts.
